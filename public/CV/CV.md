## EXPERIENCE

**Lead Machine Learning Scientist** | AI Cando (Muscat, Oman — Remote) | *(Sept 2024 - Present)*
- Architected and led the end-to-end development of a forex trading model through systematic, rigorous experimentation with Transformer (GTN), LGBM architectures.
- Engineered a robust data pipeline, optimizing feature generation from days to seconds using vectorized pandas operations and implementing a superior Take Profit/Stop Loss signal logic.
- Systematically evaluated and deployed advanced modeling techniques, including custom weighted cross-entropy and focal loss functions, learnable time-based embeddings, and multiple classifier backbones.
- Developed a two-stage (Filter → Expert) LGBM model that outperformed other models in real-world back-testing.
- Connected trained ML models to MetaTrader app for live-test and back-testing purposes, using Python and MQ5 programming language.
- Deployed and rigorously benchmarked models on high-performance cloud infrastructure (Vast.ai), utilizing NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs.
- Experienced in working with Google Cloud services for deployment.

**Lead Machine Learning Scientist** | Pejvak Rayane | *(Sept 2024 - Present)*
- Engineered a sophisticated multi-agent system for complex task automation, leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to create a standardized, extensible framework for tool use.
- Utilized various LLMs (Gemma, Qwen) to build autonomous agents for research, code generation, and data analysis.
- Developed and implemented hybrid RAG systems, combining multiple retrieval techniques to enhance contextual accuracy for specialized query domains.
