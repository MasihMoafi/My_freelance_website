### EXPERIENCE

**Lead Machine Learning Scientist, AI Cando** (Muscat, Oman â€” Remote)
*(Sept 2024 - Present)*
*   Architected and led the end-to-end development of a forex trading model through systematic, rigorous experimentation with Transformer (GTN), LGBM architectures.
*   Engineered a robust data pipeline, optimizing feature generation from days to seconds using vectorized pandas operations and implementing a superior Take Profit/Stop Loss signal logic that proved more predictive than fixed-horizon methods.
*   Systematically evaluated and deployed advanced modeling techniques, including custom weighted cross-entropy and focal loss functions, learnable time-based embeddings, and multiple classifier backbones (LightGBM, ROCKET, Transformers).
*   Developed a two-stage (Filter -> Expert) LGBM model that outperformed other models in real-world back-testing. 
*   Connected the trained ML models to metatrader app for live-test and back-testing purposes, using python and mq5 programming language.
*   Deployed and rigorously benchmarked models on high-performance cloud infrastructure (Vast.ai), utilizing NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs for training and inference.
*   Experienced in working with google-cloud services for deployment. 

**Lead Machine Learning Scientist, Pejvak Rayane**
*(Sept 2024 - Present)*
*   Engineered a sophisticated multi-agent system for complex task automation, leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to create a standardized, extensible framework for tool use (RAG, Web Search, Long-Term Memory, TTS, STT, multi-modality).
*   Utilized various LLMs (Gemma, Qwen) to build autonomous agents for research, code generation, and data analysis.
*   Developed and implemented hybrid RAG systems, combining multiple retrieval techniques to enhance contextual accuracy for specialized query domains.
