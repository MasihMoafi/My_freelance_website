# Welcome to My Blog

This is an example blog post written in Markdown. You can write about anything you want here!

## What is Frontmatter?

The section at the top between `---` lines is called **frontmatter**. It contains metadata about your post:

- `title`: The title of your blog post
- `date`: When you wrote it (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `excerpt`: A short description that appears in the blog list
- `author`: Your name
- `tags`: Categories for your post

## How to Write Posts

1. Create a new `.md` file in `app/blog/posts/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top
3. Write your content in Markdown below
4. The blog page will automatically show your new post!

## Markdown Features

You can use:
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://github.com/MasihMoafi)
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code: `const hello = "world"`
- Headers (like the ones above)

```javascript
// Even code blocks!
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
